# Models

We're now hosting the first go at this model. [See here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tMrLvCPADS6z-VxMf3aiCpjki9K3jrpp?usp=sharing) for the zipped up model, including the model.pb, variables, etc... See also the `environment.yaml` for the environment specifics. Note that were using TensorFlow v1 here because the [DeepImageJ plugin](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/index.html) within [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) needs version <= 1.15.
