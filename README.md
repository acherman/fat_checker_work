# Fat Checker
This repo is our hook into the [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/) model zoo. 


## Background
We're training a U-net to classify lipid droplets from liver samples. We use the [Zooniverse platform](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwright04/etch-a-cell-fat-checker/about/research) to get human-annotated training data.

Can also have a zipped-up directory containing scripts et al...
