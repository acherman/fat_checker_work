# Welcome to the Fat Checker repo!

## Intro
This space is a temporary space for developing the appropriate contents for sharing models from our [Etch-A-Cell Fat Checker](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwright04/etch-a-cell-fat-checker) project on [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/). At some point, we expect to transfer what we've learned here to a more official repo for our group. 

## Resources
There are three-ish steps to [making this integration with BioImage.IO work](https://bioimage.io/#/?show=contribute)
1. Make an appropriately-formatted [manifest yaml](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage.io/blob/master/docs/manifest-format.md)
2. Host it publically (HERE!) and preferably share 
3. Give them this repo's url [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimage-io-models/issues/26)
