# Fat Checker
This repo will be our hook into the [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/) model zoo. 


## Background
We're training a U-net to classify lipid droplets from liver samples. We use the [Zooniverse platform](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/dwright04/etch-a-cell-fat-checker/about/research) to get human-annotated training data.



## Where we are
These are early days. We've pulled annotations from an early iteration of the project and trained a 2D Unet (see [notebooks](https://github.com/acherman/fat_checker_work/tree/main/notebooks)) and have a model (see [models](https://github.com/acherman/fat_checker_work/tree/main/models) for a brief explanation, the actual model files [live here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tMrLvCPADS6z-VxMf3aiCpjki9K3jrpp?usp=sharing)).

We're looking to build out our complete workflow and are requesting partnership with BioImage.IO.
